A simple port of the Box2D physics engine (http://box2d.org/) to Android.

Rather than converting Box2D to Java, the port uses the Android NDK to compile
the (almost) unaltered Box2D C code, and then provides a JNI wrapper around
it for use in normal Android applications.

I'm working on the assumption that this will be faster than a pure Java port,
but I'll wait until I've finished it all and have some measurements to prove
or disprove that...

In the meantime, why not have some ASCII art?
